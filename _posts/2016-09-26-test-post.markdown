Today, I did some sprint training, based off some advice from [Max Bigras][max-bigras]. 

According to the cursory internet research I did this morning, sprint training is great for torching fat and building muscle. Compared with other exercises, it has a pretty returns on calorie burning and muscle building to time invested. According to [breaking muscle][breaking-muscle], "sprints burn 200 calories for 2.5 minutes of work." Compare that to 40 minutes running on the [treadmill] [treadmill], in which the average person burns between 486 and 557 calories. 

Clearly, sprinting has its advantages. 

If you'd like to get started with some basic sprint exercises, I'd recommend [this video][this-video].
